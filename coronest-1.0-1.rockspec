Coroutines are a powerful notion to suspend and resume execution of
lightweight threads. They can be used for instance for scheduling,
or for iteration.

When mixing these two uses, a problem arises: there is no way to specify
which `coroutine.resume` should intercept a `coroutine.yield`.

This module provides a thin wrapper around the standard `coroutine`
module to allow the definition of complex behaviors with nested
coroutines.
