     The ADS1015 device is a precision, low-power, 12-bit, I²C-compatible,
     analog-to-digital converter (ADC) offered in an ultra-small, leadless,
     X2QFN-10 package, and a VSSOP-10 package. The ADS1015 incorporates a
     low-drift voltage reference and an oscillator. The ADS1015 also incorporates
     a programmable gain amplifier (PGA) and a digital comparator. These features,
     along with a wide operating supply range, make the ADS1015 well suited for
     power- and space-constrained sensor measurement applications.
