  summary = "Fast and dependency-free uuid generation for LuaJIT",
  detailed = [[
    This module is aimed at filling a gap between performant uuid generation
    and the libuuid requirement of FFI and C bindings. Its goal is to provide
    fast uuid generation, without dependencies for OpenResty and LuaJIT.

    It is a good candidate if you want a more performant generation than pure
    Lua, without depending on libuuid.
