  summary = "Fast and dependency-free uuid generation for OpenResty/LuaJIT",
  detailed = [[
    This module is aimed at filling a gap between performant uuid generation and
    the libuuid requirement of FFI and C bindings. Its goal is to provide fast
    uuid generation, without dependencies for OpenResty and LuaJIT.

    It is a good candidate if you want a more performant generation than pure Lua,
    without depending on libuuid. It also provides very efficient uuid validation,
    using JIT PCRE if available in OpenResty, with a fallback on Lua patterns.
